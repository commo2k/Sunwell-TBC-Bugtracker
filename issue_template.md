Hello everyone

I have the same problem as Longus90.

Last night around 22 o'clock I bought my flight mount + ride.
Then I went to Orgimmer and learned a few talents. So on the whole I still played 10-15 minutes until I went offline.
So this morning I log into the game and it's all three away

Gold away
Mount away
Learn to ride away
